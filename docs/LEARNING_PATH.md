# Learning Path

## Start Here
- Read [Home](index.md) to learn the goal and how to run the proxy.
- Run the proxy once, even before deep reading.

## Suggested Reading Order
1. [HTTP vs HTTPS](HTTP_VS_HTTPS.md)
2. [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md)
3. [How a proxy works](HOW_A_PROXY_WORKS.md)
4. [Project structure](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)
5. [Segmentation](SEGMENTATION.md)
6. [Experiments](EXPERIMENTS.md)

## What to Focus On First
- The basic flow: browser -> proxy -> server.
- The CONNECT tunnel for HTTPS.
- How rules decide direct, upstream, or block.

## Learn by Doing
- Change one rule and test again.
- Use curl to see small changes.
- Read logs while you test.
