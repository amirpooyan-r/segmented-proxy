# Learning Path

## Start Here
- Read README.md to learn the goal and how to run the proxy.
- Run the proxy once, even before deep reading.

## Suggested Reading Order
1. docs/HTTP_VS_HTTPS.md
2. docs/GLOSSARY.md
3. docs/HOW_A_PROXY_WORKS.md
4. docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
5. docs/SEGMENTATION.md
6. examples/EXPERIMENTS.md

## What to Focus On First
- The basic flow: browser -> proxy -> server.
- The CONNECT tunnel for HTTPS.
- How rules decide direct, upstream, or block.

## Learn by Doing
- Change one rule and test again.
- Use curl to see small changes.
- Read logs while you test.
