# About This Project

## What This Project Is
SegmentedProxy is an educational and experimental proxy.
It helps readers observe how data delivery changes when timing and chunking are controlled.
It is designed to support learning, not to be a full reference manual.

## What This Project Is Not
This is not a production proxy.
It is not a DPI bypass.
It is not a traffic hiding or evasion tool.
It is not a MITM proxy.

## Who This Project Is For
Beginners who want a gentle introduction to proxy ideas.
Intermediate users who want to explore traffic behavior.
Advanced users who want a conceptual review of protocol flow.

## How the Documentation Is Organized
`docs/SEGMENTATION.md` explains what segmentation means and why it matters.
`docs/LABS.md` provides guided exercises for hands-on learning.
`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` helps with common setup and operational problems.
`docs/FAQ.md` answers behavior and concept questions in a quick format.
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` gives a high-level view of how parts fit together.
`docs/ADVANCED_TCP_BEHAVIOR.md` is optional reading for deeper TCP concepts.

## Suggested Reading Paths
For beginners, start with `docs/SEGMENTATION.md`, then use `docs/LABS.md`.
For intermediate users, read `docs/SEGMENTATION.md`, then `docs/FAQ.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
For advanced readers, scan `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, then `docs/ADVANCED_TCP_BEHAVIOR.md`.
It is fine to skip advanced documents if you only need the basics.

## How to Experiment Safely
Focus on observation and learning, not bypass attempts.
Change one setting at a time so results are easier to understand.
Use logs to confirm what the proxy is doing.

## Project Philosophy
Learning by observation comes first.
Clear boundaries help users understand what the tool does and does not do.
Documentation aims to be honest and easy to follow.
Exploration should be calm and incremental.

## If You Feel Confused
It is normal to feel unsure when learning networking topics.
Slow down, read one section at a time, and revisit the basics when needed.
